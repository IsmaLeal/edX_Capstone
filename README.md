This repository is for the "Data Science: Capstone" course (PH125.9x) by HarvardX and edX.

The goal of the first project was to predict movie ratings using the Movielens dataset.

The second project consisted of choosing a dataset to apply the ML techniques learnt throughout the previous courses, apart from the linear regression. The dataset chosen was Processed Cleveland, a subset of the Heart Disease Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning repository, a public data set donated on 1988. The goal of the project is to accurately predict the presence of a heart disease using the data regarding ECG stress tests before and after undergoing some physical exercise.
